## üìç Overview

This application is a small effort of ours to bring a change in the food industry. In cosmopolitan cities, there are thousands of foodies with different requirements. While some miss their "Ghar ka khana", there are others who can cook the most delicious food. We are a bridge for both these types of people. While, the platform will allow homemakers, caterers, and tiffin services to reach a wider audience and provide a professional setup for their business/hobby, people living away from home, the elderly, office going people will have hot and delicious homemade-food at their doorstep.
